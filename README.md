# Welcome

This repository is used as a source for every code I have written in learning C#, .NET 8, etc. Explore more in [Microsoft Learn](https://github.com/autorejecttop/microsoft_learn.git) or [.NET Learn](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn).

## Lists

### List of what I will learn

1. **C#** because it's for foundational knowledge
2. **ASP.NET Core** because it's performant, structured, and lots of good jobs
3. **.NET MAUI** because I hate Flutter and React Native kinda sucked

### List of what piqued my interest

1. **F#** because it's like haskell(?) meaning parallel computing meaning GPU meaning AI/ML and the performance is [considerable](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/box-plot-summary-charts.html)
2. **ML.NET** because hurr durr AI
3. **Unity** because it's mesmerizing

### List of what I ignore

1. **Blazor** because the performance is [the worst](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/)
2. **.NET Cloud and Microservices** because I already know Docker and a Kubernetes course already exists too. I would do this when I'm done with everything else.
