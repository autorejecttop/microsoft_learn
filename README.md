# Welcome

This repository is used as a source for every code I have written in learning C#, .NET 8, etc. Explore more in [Microsoft Learn](https://github.com/autorejecttop/microsoft_learn.git) or [.NET Learn](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn).

## Lists

### List of what I will learn

- [x] **C#** because it's for foundational knowledge and it felt like writing TypeScript.
- [ ] **ASP.NET Core** because it's performant, structured, and lots of good jobs.

### List of what piqued my interest

- [ ] **ML.NET** suprisingly underrated? I read lots of people use this in production.
- [ ] **Unity** because it has reverted it's runtime fee. Would be great to learn on my free time.
- [ ] **F#** because I'm interested in functional programming, have touched Haskell before, and the performance is [considerable](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/box-plot-summary-charts.html).
- [ ] **.NET MAUI** because I don't need to leave C# for cross-platform apps. Based on what I've read, it's understaffed, underfunded, underdeveloped. Microsoft even uses React/React Native for their Office apps. No linux support too. Still wondering to do this or Avalonia (probably do both).

### List of what I ignore

- [ ] **Blazor** because the performance is [the worst](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/). **_Just do Angular_**.
- [ ] **.NET Cloud and Microservices** because I already know Docker and a Kubernetes course already exists too. I would do this when I'm done with everything else.
