# Welcome

This repository is used as a source for every code I have written in learning C#, .NET 8, etc. Explore more in [Microsoft Learn](https://github.com/autorejecttop/microsoft_learn.git) or [.NET Learn](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn).

## Lists

### List of what I will learn

1. **C#** because it's for foundational knowledge and it felt like writing TypeScript.
2. **ASP.NET Core** because it's performant, structured, and lots of good jobs.

### List of what piqued my interest

1. **ML.NET** suprisingly underrated? I read lots of people use this in production.
2. **Unity** because it has reverted it's runtime fee. Would be great to learn on my free time.

### List of what I ignore

1. **Blazor** because the performance is [the worst](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/)
2. **.NET Cloud and Microservices** because I already know Docker and a Kubernetes course already exists too. I would do this when I'm done with everything else.
3. _**(moved from the list of what I will learn)**_ **.NET MAUI** ~~because I hate Flutter and React Native kinda sucked~~ understaffed, underfunded, underdeveloped. Microsoft even uses React/React Native for their Office apps.
4. _**(moved from the list of what I will learn)**_ **F#** ~~because it's like haskell(?) meaning parallel computing meaning GPU meaning AI/ML and the performance is [considerable](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/box-plot-summary-charts.html)~~ treated like another child in .NET, just go with C#.
